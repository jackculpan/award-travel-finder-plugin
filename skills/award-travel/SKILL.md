# Award Travel Finder

Search award flight availability across 19 airlines and 14 loyalty programs using points and miles. Powered by the Award Travel Finder MCP server.

## Available MCP Tools

### search_availability
Search award seats for a specific route and date.

**Parameters:**
- `airline`: airline slug (e.g. `british_airways`, `qatar_airways`, `cathay_pacific`, `virgin_atlantic`, `iberia`, `emirates`, `qantas`, `alaska_airlines`, `american_airlines`, `jetblue`, `etihad`, `frontier` — call `search_all_airlines` if unsure)
- `departure_code`: 3-letter IATA code (e.g. LHR)
- `arrival_code`: 3-letter IATA code (e.g. JFK)
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD

Returns cabin-by-cabin availability with points costs.

### search_monthly_availability
Search an entire month for availability. Best for finding flexible dates. Can take up to 90 seconds.

**Parameters:**
- `airline`: airline slug
- `departure_code`: 3-letter IATA code
- `arrival_code`: 3-letter IATA code
- `date`: YYYY-MM or YYYY-MM-DD (uses the month)

### search_all_airlines
Fan out a single date across every supported airline at once. Use when the user doesn't specify an airline.

**Parameters:**
- `departure_code`: 3-letter IATA code
- `arrival_code`: 3-letter IATA code
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD

### search_hybrid
Find the cheapest way to fly by combining cash tickets with award redemptions into one split-ticket journey. Best for premium cabins on long-haul routes.

**Parameters:**
- `origin`: 3-letter IATA code
- `destination`: 3-letter IATA code
- `date`: YYYY-MM-DD
- `cabin`: `economy` | `business` | `first` (default: business)
- `points_value_cents`: How you value points in cents per point (default: 1.5)

Returns: direct cash price, best full-award option, and hybrid split options ranked by effective cost.

### get_pricing
Get the award chart for a route. Shows points per cabin class, off-peak and peak. No date needed.

**Parameters:**
- `airline`: airline slug
- `departure_code`: 3-letter IATA code
- `arrival_code`: 3-letter IATA code

### get_program_rates
Get full award chart for a loyalty program (zones, cabin pricing, partner rules).

**Parameters:**
- `program`: Program slug — one of `british-airways`, `iberia`, `qatar-airways`, `aer-lingus`, `virgin-atlantic`, `aeroplan`, `flying-blue`, `cathay-pacific`, `singapore-airlines`, `emirates`, `etihad`, `turkish-airlines`, `ana`, `jetblue`

### get_buy_points_pricing
Current "buy miles" promotions, in case it's cheaper than redeeming.

### get_status_matches
Which programs will status-match a given tier, and how long it lasts.

### Hotels
- `search_hotels` — Find hotels by city/area for a date range.
- `get_hotel_availability` — Award nights at a specific property.
- `monitor_hotel_price` — Watch a property and ping you on price drops.
- `list_hotel_bookings` / `get_hotel_booking` — Track hotel award reservations.

### Trip portfolio (per user)
- `add_flight_booking` / `list_flight_bookings` / `get_flight_booking` / `update_flight_booking` / `delete_flight_booking`
- `update_points_balance` / `list_points_balances` / `get_portfolio`

## Workflow: Hybrid Search (Cash + Points)

1. Use `search_hybrid` with origin, destination, date, and cabin class.
2. Review the comparison: direct cash vs full award vs hybrid options.
3. The best hybrid often uses cheap short-haul award positioning (e.g. 16,500 Avios LHR→DUB) combined with a cheaper cash long-haul from the hub.
4. Warn the user about split-ticket risks: no IRROPS protection, carry-on only.

## Workflow: Finding Award Flights

1. **Confirm route and airline.** Convert city names to IATA codes. If unsure which airline, use `search_all_airlines` to fan out across every supported airline.
2. **Check pricing first** with `get_pricing` to show what the route costs in points per cabin class.
3. **Search availability** with `search_availability` for a specific date, or `search_monthly_availability` for flexible dates.
4. **Present results clearly.** Format as a table showing date, cabin class, seats available, and points required.

## Workflow: Comparing Programs

1. Use `get_program_rates` for each program the user wants to compare.
2. Focus comparison on the route/region they care about.
3. Highlight which program offers the best value per cabin class. Note fuel surcharge differences (BA, Virgin = high; Aeroplan, Asia Miles, Flying Blue = lower or none on partners).

## Authentication

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 by default. On first tool call, the client redirects the user to awardtravelfinder.com to sign up (or sign in) and approve access — about 30 seconds, free, no credit card. Tokens auto-refresh.

Free tier: **50 searches/month** per account. Paid tiers (150/month and up) at https://awardtravelfinder.com/pricing for power users.

X-API-Key headers are still supported for legacy clients and server-to-server agents.
